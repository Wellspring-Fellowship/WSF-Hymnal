Majesty, worship his majesty;
Unto Jesus be all glory, honor, and praise.

Majesty, kingdom authority,
Flow from his throne unto his own, his anthem raise.

So exalt, lift up on high the name of Jesus.
Magnify, come glorify Christ Jesus, the King.

Majesty, worship his majesty,
Jesus who died, now glorified, King of all kings.
