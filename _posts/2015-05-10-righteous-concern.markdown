Verse 1
God seems depraved and indifferent to allow all this pain. 
Do you question how can it be? 
Isn’t this the question caused men’s faith to fail because they could not see.

Chorus
God has a righteous concern a righteous concern! 
He’s not indifferent a million miles away. 
He has a righteous concern a righteous concern.
Only trust Him ­ it’s all for your good.

Verse 2
Are you suffering today? Does He seem far away? Are you tempted to give up on Him?
Is your faith at the brink? Is it ready to sink? Don’t lose hope! He has a righteous concern.

Verse 3
Is your marriage suffering? Is your child wayward? Do financial difficulties reign?
Are you lonely today? Is your health fading away? Don’t lose hope! 
He has a righteous concern.
