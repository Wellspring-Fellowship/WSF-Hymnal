O how He loves you and me, O how He loves you and me,
He gave His life, what more could He give?
O how He loves you, O how He loves me,
O how He loves you and me.

Jesus to Calv'ry did go, His love for mankind to show;
What He did there brought hope from despair:
O how He loves you, O how He loves me,
O how He loves you and me.
