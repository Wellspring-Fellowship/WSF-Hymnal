Holiness, holiness is what I long for;
Holiness is what I need.
Holiness, holiness
Is what You want from me.

[Chorus:]
Take my heart and form it;
Take my mind transform it;
Take my will conform it
To Yours, to Yours, oh Lord.

Faithfulness, faithfulness is what I long for;
Faithfulness is what I need.
Faithfulness, faithfulness
Is what You want from me.

[Chorus:]

Righteousness, righteousness is what I long for;
Righteousness is what I need.
Righteousness, righteousness
Is what You want from me.

[Chorus:]
