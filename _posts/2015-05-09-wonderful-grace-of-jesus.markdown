Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my spirit free;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

Refrain:
Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
Higher than the mountains, sparkling like a fountain,
All sufficient grace for me.
Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and shame.
O magnify the precious Name of Jesus,
Praise His Name!
